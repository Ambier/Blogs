# Project Experience

## IRIP Lab

> The laboratory of intelligent recognition and image processing (IRIP) (2013.12-Now)

### Image Search

As a cooperative project with Sogou company, we research and optimize the techniques employed in the industrial Search by Image Application. The main processes of Image Search app are all concerned, including Feature Extraction, Feature Processing, Feature Indexing and Similarity Calculation. Our work has been summarized into a paper which is contributed to KDD2015. In this project, i conducted most of the experiments and helped the Professor to fulfill the paper.

### Mesh Simplification

This project is used as a data pre-processing for detecting unusual object in the geologic structure. I implement the Simplification Algorithm based Vertex Smoothing using C++ code.

## QQ IM department

> Input Method(IM) department of Tencent(2012.4-2013.4)

### Data Filtering

This project focuses on removing unhealthy and illegal data out  of data collected from the Internet. I compared the performance of SVM and Naive Bayes(NB) on this problem, and implement NB algorithm and pre-processing program using python code.

### Cloud IM Engine

Cloud IM Engine takes a long pinyin string as input, and decodes into a Chinese sentence. I developed the code for the sentence decoding part of the kernel, and add property of mixture input of chinese pinyin and english words. This project is developed by C++.

### Language Model Improvement

In this project, i research the improvement methods for the process of training language model, and implement an iterative training process based on hadoop platform, using Java.

# Competition Experience

## BDTC

> The first big data technology innovation and entrepreneurship innovation competition(2013.9-2013.11)

This competition is held by CCF,  I designed and implemented the solution based on hadoop+SVM to solve the keyword classification problem of baidu, which is one of the five problems.```Our solution won the third prize of the competition.```

## Baidu Hackathon 2014

> Light application hackathon of Baidu(2014.8.2-2014.8.3)

As a member of three students' team, we develop an application called 'time guest' to help people spend time when they wait outside the restaurant or cinema and so on. I implement the function of map and chat in this project. ```Our app won the prize of best business prospect.```

## Baidu Hackathon 2013

> Cloud programming hackathon of Baidu(2013.7.20-2013.7.21)

As a member of five students' team, we develop an android application to help people buy green healthy fruits and vegetables. I implement the function of map to show people the nearest shop position.```Our app won the LBS special award.```
